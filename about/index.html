        Hey, I’m Brianna!
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        I’m a recent graduate from Columbia University, where I studied computer science and biomedical engineering. I currently live in New York. I’ve interned at Spectrum (Charter Communications) as a software engineer in the Application Services team and have computational and wet-lab research experience from the Institute of Cancer Genetics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Some of my favorite independent projects I’ve worked on are a Bitcoin and gold trading model, breast cancer metastasis model, and rainfall rate estimation model.

        In my free time, I like to dance ballet, bake cookies, take photos, and update my Beli.
