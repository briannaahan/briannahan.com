            I’m a recent graduate from Columbia University, where I studied computer science and biomedical engineering.
            I currently live in New York, where I work as a software engineer at SmartAdvocate and part-time at a bakery.
            I have pervious software engineering experience from Spectrum (Charter Communications) and Columbia Build Lab.
            I also have computational and wet-lab research experience from the Institute of Cancer Genetics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Stony Brook University.
            Some of my favorite independent projects I’ve worked on are

            Aside from my career and research interests, I like to dance ballet, bake cookies, take photos, update <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://beliapp.co/app/briannahan">my Beli</a>, and go on side quests.
